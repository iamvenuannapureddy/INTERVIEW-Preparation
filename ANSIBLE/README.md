## **4. Hands-on Ansible Projects for Interviews**
Practical experience is **key** to cracking Ansible interviews. Try implementing these projects:

### **Basic Projects**
1. **Automate Apache/Nginx installation on Linux Servers**  
2. **Deploy a simple application using Ansible Playbook**  
3. **Configure and manage system users and groups**  

### **Intermediate Projects**
4. **Use Ansible Vault to manage secrets in Playbooks**  
5. **Deploy a multi-node web application with Ansible Roles**  
6. **Ansible Dynamic Inventory for AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)**  

### **Advanced Projects**
7. **CI/CD Pipeline using Ansible and Jenkins**  
8. **Deploy Kubernetes Cluster using Ansible**

## **5. Ansible Best Practices**
- **Keep playbooks modular** â†’ Use Roles and Includes  
- **Use `ansible-lint`** â†’ Validate playbook syntax  
- **Use Vault for secrets management** â†’ Avoid plain text credentials  
- **Follow idempotency** â†’ Ensure tasks only change when necessary  
- **Use Dynamic Inventory** â†’ Manage multi-environment automation  
- **Integrate Ansible with CI/CD** â†’ Automate deployments  
- **Limit privilege escalation** â†’ Use `become` wisely
