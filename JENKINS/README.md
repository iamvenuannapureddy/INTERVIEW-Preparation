## **8. Sample Jenkins Pipeline for CI/CD**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/myrepo/sample-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'scp target/*.war user@server:/opt/tomcat/webapps/'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

âœ… **What This Pipeline Does:**  
- **Clones code from Git**  
- **Builds a Java application using Maven**  
- **Runs automated tests**  
- **Deploys the application to a Tomcat server**
